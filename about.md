I'm Logan, a software engineer and game developer from Los Angeles, California. Enjoy your stay on this blog, where I will get excited and write _way too many_ words in a very short time about topics I'm interested in, and then I will forget about the blog's existence for several months, and all will be silent, and then I will remember, and then we will repeat, unto eternity.
