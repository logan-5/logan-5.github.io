I've decided to:







  1. Actually kinda sorta use this blog
  2. Take it in a technical direction






I've got a pie-in-the-sky dream to learn more about graphics programming this year, something I've always been fascinated by, and have dabbled in quite a bit at work and in personal projects, but until now I've been too chicken to take the bull by the horns, become a Jedi Master, and mix metaphors.







I also write C++ full-time at work, and am constantly learning new and interesting things about it. I've got a huge amount of interest in programming languages, old and new, and am engaged in an eternal Sisyphean struggle of starting and restarting a personal project of writing an interpreter/bytecode compiler/actual compiler/everything-under-the-sun for a scripting language I've designed. Coming soon. Or whatever.







All that to say: this blog thing is gonna go great. Right?
