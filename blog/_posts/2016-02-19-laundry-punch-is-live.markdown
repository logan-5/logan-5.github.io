				Sometime in September 2015, a few curious factors aligned. I was sitting on my bed in my apartment playing an iOS game called Burger (go check it out), marveling about how simple it was, and yet frustratingly addicting.  I was curious about whether I could likewise isolate a singular pleasurable sensory experience (e.g. flipping a patty onto a bun) and make a game revolving around it.  My thoughts were interrupted, unfortunately, by the buzz of the dryer next door to my apartment, which had just finished drying my clothes.

By the time I returned to my apartment with my clothes, Laundry Punch was born; the game where you sort your shirts by color into their hampers by punching them.

I was eager to develop the game in Swift, as up to then all my iOS development had been in Objective-C, and I wanted to learn the ropes.  I chose Cocos2d/SpriteBuilder, an old friend, as the engine, so I could focus on Swift and the game itself without having to learn a new engine API on top of everything.

The rest is history.  I had an amazingly fun time developing the game, and even more fun beta testing it with some really good friends of mine, who were eager to give their suggestions and help improve it (some of the best parts of the game came from them, thanks guys).  The game was basically finished by mid-late October 2015.  Whether or not I had accomplished my goal of matching the simplicity of Burger with the fun of Burger was questionable, but I was confident that I had made a fun game.

AND THEN

I sat around for a few months doing absolutely nothing with it, and I don't know why.

AND THEN

I submitted it to the App Store, and it was approved, and it's live, and it's free, and it's fun??

May the hordes of shirts be cleaned ever so violently by the might of your reigning fist.  Enjoy.
